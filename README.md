# Decentralized Academic Record System

## Current System
Managing academic records in universities involves manual verification processes, paper-based documentation, and potential delays in accessing or verifying student records.

## Solution
Implementing a decentralized academic record system using blockchain technology can streamline the management and verification of academic records. Smart contracts can automate the verification process, while cryptographic signatures ensure the authenticity of documents.

## How it Works

**Viewing Records:** Anyone can view records using IDs like 101, 102, etc.

**Uploading Records:** To upload records, use a specific mnemonic. Otherwise, you'll receive a "Not an admin" message.

**Admin Operations:** On the main page, admins can:

**Add a new student**
**View student records**
**Search for students by ID or name
Adding Courses:** Admins can add new courses to a student's record by clicking on the courses in the student entry. Here, they can input the course name and grades received.

**Adding Students:** When adding a student, you'll be prompted to log in if you haven't already. Then, you can add the student's ID and name to the records.

## Benefits

- **Transparency:** The decentralized nature of the system ensures transparency in record management and verification processes.
- **Efficiency:** Automation of verification processes and elimination of manual paperwork lead to faster record access and verification.
- **Data Security:** Blockchain technology ensures data security and immutability, reducing the risk of tampering or unauthorized access to academic records.
- **Trust and Authenticity:** Cryptographic signatures provide a secure method for verifying the authenticity of documents, enhancing trust in the academic record system.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multiple Institutes' Decentralized Systems:** Each institute can have its own decentralized records system, allowing for a network of interconnected academic record systems.
2. **Posting Certificates & Degrees:** Institutes can post certificates and degrees of their students directly into the decentralized records, ensuring easy access and verification.
3. **Student Record Management:** Students can view and manage access to their records, controlling who can view or verify their academic achievements.
4. **Public Record Verification:** Anyone with access can view a record and verify it through the institute's address, ensuring transparency and trust in the academic record system.
